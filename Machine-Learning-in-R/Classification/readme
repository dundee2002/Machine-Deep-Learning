End-to-end ML Modeling process for classification problem
  1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
  2. Algorithm selection
  3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Algorithms
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net
  3. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  5. Naive Bayes (NB)
  6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  7. Decision Tree (Classification & Regression Trees; CART)
  8. C5.0
  9. Bagged CART
  10. Random Forest
  11. Stochastic Gradient Boosting
 
Examples
  1. UCI pima indians diabetes data (binary class)
  2. UCI breast cancer data (binary class)
  3. UCI iris data (multi-class)
  4. UCI wine data (multi-class)
