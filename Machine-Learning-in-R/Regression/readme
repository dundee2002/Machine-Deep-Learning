End-to-end ML modelling process for regression problem
  1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualizing, scaling
  2. Algorithm selection
  3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, metrics (mae,mse,rmse,r2-score)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Algorithms
  1. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares; OLS)
  2. Partial Least Square Regression (PLS)
  3. Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net
  4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  6. Bagged Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
  7. Decision Tree (Classification & Regression Trees; CART)
  8. Bagged CART
  9. Random Forest
  10. Stochastic Gradient Boosting 

Examples
  1. StatLib Calfornia housing price
  2. UCI Boston house price 
  3. Hyundai Cruise ship data
