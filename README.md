## Machine Learning
============
** End-to-end modelling process **
------------
- Data loading and preprocessing: missing data, visualizing, scaling, text preprocessing, etc
- Algorithm or architecture selection 
- Model evaluation: train-test split, cross validation, metrics, etc
- Hyperparameter tuning 
- Final model saving to disk and loading
