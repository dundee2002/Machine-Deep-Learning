End-to-end MLP modeling process for classification problem
 1. Data loading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
 2. Baseline model architecture selection: hidden layers, neurons
 3. Model evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, learning curves, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
 4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search (batch_size, epochs, initializer, optimizer, activation function, dropout, etc)
 5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Examples: 
 1. Binary classification: ISLR college data, kaggle HR, titanic data, UCI pima indians diabetes, breast cancer data
 2. Multi-class classification: kaggel otto data, UCI iris, wine data
