End-to-end MLP modeling process for classification problem
  1. Data loading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
  2. Baseline model architecture selection: hidden layers, neurons
  3. Model evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, learning curves, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search (batch_size, epochs, initializer, optimizer, activation function, dropout, etc)
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Examples
  1. ISLR college data (binary class)
  2. kaggle HR data (binary class)
  3. kaggle titanic data (binary class)
  4. UCI pima indians diabetes data (binary class)
  5. UCI breast cancer data (binary class)
  6. kaggel otto data (muiti-class)
  7. UCI iris data (muiti-class)
  8. UCI wine data (muiti-class)
