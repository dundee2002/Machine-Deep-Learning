End-to-end problem solving process
 1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
 2. Algorithm selection: K-Means, Hierarchical
 3. Optimal cluster selection: Elbow method, Dendrogram

Examples: ISLR college data, sklearn make_blobs data, kaggle social network ads, mall customers data
