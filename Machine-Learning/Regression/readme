End-to-end problem solving process
 1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualizing, scaling
 2. Algorithm selection: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, KNeighbors, SVM, Decision Tree, RandomForest, XGBoost
 3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, metrics (mse,r2-score)
 4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
 5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Examples: StatLib Calfornia housing price, UCI Boston house price
