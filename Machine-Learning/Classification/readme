End-to-end problem solving process
 1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
 2. Algorithm selection: LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, KNeighbors, GaussianNB, SVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest, XGBoost
 3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
 4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
 5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Examples: 
 1. Binary classification: ISLR college data, kaggle HR, titanic data, UCI pima indians diabetes, breast cancer data
 2. Multi-class classification: kaggel otto data, UCI iris, wine data
