End-to-end ML Modeling process for classification problem
  1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling
  2. Algorithm selection: LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, KNeighbors, GaussianNB, SVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest, XGBoost
  3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading
