End-to-end MLP modelling process for regression problem
  1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualizing, scaling
  2. Baseline model selection: hidden layers, nodes
  3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, learning curves, metrics (mse,r2-score)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search (batch_size, epochs, initializer, optimizer, activation function, dropout, etc)
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading
