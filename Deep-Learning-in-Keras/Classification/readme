End-to-end MLP modeling process for classification problem
  1. Data loading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling, text/image preprocessing,
  2. Baseline model architecture selection: hidden layers, neurons
  3. Model evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, learning curves, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search (batch_size, epochs, initializer, optimizer, activation function, dropout, etc)
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading
