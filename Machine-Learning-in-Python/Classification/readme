End-to-end ML Modeling process for classification problem
  1. Data reading and preprocessing: missing data, visualization, scaling, text preprocessing
  2. Algorithm selection: LogisticRegression, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, KNeighbors, GaussianNB, SVM, DecisionTree, RandomForest, XGBoost
  3. Model Evaluation: train-test split, k-fold cross validation, stratified cv, metrics (accuracy,recall,precision,f1-score,confusion matrix)
  4. Hyperparameter tuning: grid search
  5. Final model Saving into disk and loading

Algorithms
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  4. Naive Bayes (NB)
  5. Decision Tree
  6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  7. Random Forest
  8. XGBoost
